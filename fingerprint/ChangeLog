	* aes2501.c:
	Apply a patch made by Herton Ronaldo Krzesinski: if the device is not
	present, the _dev structure isn't initialized and the system gets an
	oops on exit.

	* aes2501.c:
	Apply Vasily Khoruzhick's new patch: rewrite image processing functions.
	Thus, there should be no more significant common points with aes2501-wy.

	* aes2501.c:
	In order to respect the license of aes2501-wy, on which this driver is
	based, begin to rewrite some functions. Thus, better handle histograms.
	One more strip is often processed, but that is more logical like this.

	* aes2501_regs.h:
	Enumerate all used registers for convenience.

2007-11-03  Cyrille Bagard <nocbos@gmail.com>

	* aes2501.c:
	Clean the code. Take care of signals when processes are awaking.
	Apply Vasily Khoruzhick's new patch: autodetect picture reversing needs
	and fix kernel oops in case of module removal.

	* Makefile:
	Remove hidden files and clean the rules. KERNELDIR has to be overrided
	from the sheel if needed now.

	* aes2501.c:
	Apply Vasily Khoruzhick's patch and thus increase the resulting pictures
	quality. Many thanks to him !

	* Makefile:
	Add two new rules: usertest and clean.

	* usertest.c:
	Initial commit.

	* aes2501.c:
	Make INIT_WORK macro working with 2.6.20+ kernels. Many thanks to
	Miguel Gea Milvaques <xerakko> for the patch !

2007-06-13  Cyrille Bagard <nocbos@gmail.com>

	* aes2501.c:
	* aes2501_regs.h:
	Complete translation of all binary communications using well documented
	registers and values (as often as possible).

2007-06-13  Cyrille Bagard <nocbos@gmail.com>

	* aes2501.c:
	Increase communication speed by buffering bulk out. Output data
	need to be flushed at the end now.

2007-06-13  Cyrille Bagard <nocbos@gmail.com>

	* aes2501.c:
	* aes2501_regs.h:
	Translate binary data used in finger detection. Some register values
	still need to be understood. Note: some hex values are reserved bits
	in registers.

2007-06-12  Cyrille Bagard <nocbos@gmail.com>

	* aes2501.c:
	Begin the binary translation: the "standby" function now uses understood
	instructions and prints debug status information if needed. CTRL2 register
	value needs to be checked.

	* aes2501_regs.h:
	Define the interesting hex values for the following registers:
	CTRL2, STAT, TREGC and TREGD.

2007-06-12  Cyrille Bagard <nocbos@gmail.com>

	* aes2501.c:
	Clean the driver a little bit by removing old piece of code to handle
	a character device in the old way.

2007-06-12  Cyrille Bagard <nocbos@gmail.com>

	* aes2501.c:
	Use an own work queue. Scanning now starts with the AES2501_IOC_TEST
	ioctl command. Reading the /dev entry blocks until data is available.

2007-06-12  Cyrille Bagard <nocbos@gmail.com>

	* aes2501.c:
	* aes2501.h:
	* Makefile:
	Initial [crappy] commit.
